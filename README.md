A Java graphical user interface that demonstrates some of the properties and algorithms of the graph data type.


#
Adding vertices: Select "Add Vertex" and click on the screen wherever you would like to place a vertex.
#
Adding edges: Select "Add Edges" and select a vertex to be the first endpoint of an edge. Once selected, the vertex will be highlighted. To draw edges, click on as many vertices as desired.
in order to connect them with the initial vertex. To deselect a vertex, simply click again on the selected vertex.
#
Removing vertices and their associated edges: Select "Remove Vertex" and click on a vertex.
#
Removing edges: Select "Remove Edge" and click on an edge.
#
Moving vertices: Click on a vertex to select it to be moved. Then, click anywhere on the screen to move the vertex to that location.
#
Adding all edges: Click "Add All Edges" in order to completely connect the graph. 
#
Showing connected components: Click "Connected Components" and the connected components of the graph will be highlighted in different colors.
#
Showing cut vertices: "Click "Show Cut Vetices" and all of the cut vertices will be highlighted.
